    <p style="position: sticky;">
        The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes. <br>
        Inline boxes use just some of the behavior defined in the box model. <br>
        The model defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on a page. <br>
        To add some additional complexity, there is a standard and an alternate box model.
