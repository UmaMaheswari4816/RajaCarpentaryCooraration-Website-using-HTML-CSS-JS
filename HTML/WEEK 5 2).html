        The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes. <br>
        Inline boxes use just some of the behavior defined in the box model. <br>
        The model defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on a page. <br>
        To add some additional complexity, there is a standard and an alternate box model.

    <p style="background-color:yellow; width: 350px;
    height: 150px;
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 25px;
    border: 5px solid black;">
    <i>The actual space taken up by the box will be 410px wide (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5) and 210px high (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5).</i><br>
